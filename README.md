Title: World Happiness 2021 Visualization Project

Introduction:
In this project, I had the opportunity to explore the fascinating world of data visualization using Python and R programming. My goal was to create an interactive and informative visualization that would shed light on the global happiness levels in 2021. The World Happiness Report is an annual publication that ranks countries based on their citizens' self-reported well-being, and I wanted to bring this data to life through engaging visualizations.

Data Collection:
The first step of this project was to gather the necessary data. I obtained the World Happiness Report data for 2021, which included scores for various factors such as GDP per capita, social support, life expectancy, and more. This data served as the foundation for the project.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
To ensure the accuracy and consistency of the data, I performed data cleaning and preprocessing. This involved handling missing values, standardizing data formats, and ensuring data integrity.

Visualization Techniques:
For the core of the project, I leveraged Python's powerful data visualization libraries, such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. These tools allowed me to create a wide range of charts and graphs, each with a specific purpose. I aimed to provide a comprehensive view of global happiness by visualizing data in various ways:

1. World Map: I plotted happiness scores on a world map to show the regional distribution of happiness.
2. Bar Charts: I used bar charts to compare the happiness scores of different countries and their ranking.
3. Correlation Matrix: I created a correlation matrix to explore the relationships between happiness and various contributing factors.
4. Line Charts: I displayed trends in happiness scores for select countries over multiple years.

Machine Learning Tools: To dive deeper into the dataset and understand the relationships between various factors and happiness scores, I employed a set of machine learning models. These models included:

Linear Regression: A fundamental model for predicting happiness scores based on predictor variables.
Random Forest Regressor: A powerful ensemble learning method that excels in capturing complex relationships within the data.
Decision Tree Model: A model that breaks down the data into a tree-like structure for decision-making.
Random Forest Model: An ensemble of decision trees, enhancing predictive accuracy.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Model: A non-parametric model used for pattern recognition and regression tasks.

Interactive Features:
To enhance the user experience, I integrated interactivity into the visualizations. Viewers could hover over data points for more information, toggle between different charts, and filter data by specific criteria. These features made the project not only informative but also engaging.

Insights:
Through the visualizations, I was able to draw several key insights from the World Happiness Report for 2021. These insights included identifying the happiest and least happy countries, exploring the impact of various factors on happiness, and tracking changes in happiness over time.

Conclusion:
The World Happiness 2021 Visualization Project was a valuable opportunity to apply my data visualization skills and share meaningful insights with a broader audience. It showcased my ability to work with real-world data, clean and preprocess it, and create interactive visualizations that tell a compelling story. I hope you find this project not only informative but also inspiring, as it exemplifies the power of data visualization in making complex data more accessible and understandable.
